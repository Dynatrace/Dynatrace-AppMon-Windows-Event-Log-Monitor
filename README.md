## Windows Event Log Monitor

![images_community/download/attachments/174469104/icon.png](images_community/download/attachments/174469104/icon.png) The Windows Event Log Plugin will monitor the Windows Event Log for the existance
of a given event. It stores the event details in a SQL database so that it knows where it ended the last time it ran so it's not seeing the same events over and over.
